<div class="post"><h1>A Word That I Hate</h1>
<br>
I fucking hate the word "Himbo".
<br>
<br>

So while i was eating my breakfast, I was reminiscing on random memories when this one with a old friend popped up. We were in his car chatting when he brought up that someone called him a himbo. His smile dropped as soon as i said, "I don't see it." 

<br>
<br>
I felt bad because he probably thought i perceived him as an ugly fuck or something, but I've just never been great at actually explaining my thoughts IRL. Plus, back then i didn't really have my thoughts sorted on why i hated someone calling him a himbo.
<br>
<br>
But after i spent some time sitting on it, i finally know why i fucking hate calling real people himbo. Don't get me wrong, I don't give a damn if you call fictional characters himbo, shiiii i'll join in! But it's so fucking weird to call a person a "himbo" to their face. Like, "Aww, you're so handsome and nice. But you ain't got nothing going on between your ears, pookie!"

<br>
<br>
You're calling someone stupid, bruh. To their face.

<br>
<br>
It's such a backhanded compliment. All brawns, no brain headass. Saying, "Your stupid, but you have heart." is like saying, "Well, you're pretty on the outside at least." 

<br>
<br>
???
<br>
<br>
You proud to be called a fucking moron?? 


<br>
<br>

Anywayss, i'm done ranting for today.

Came across this video this morning, definitely one that i relate to a whole lot lately.
<br>
<br>
This for sure has been the theme in my life so far this year. Learning to find comfort with myself, in the silence, and comfort with myself as my own best companion. Not in a doomer/misanthropist sort of way, but in a "I'm flowing down the lazy river of life" sort of way, y'know?
<br>
<br>
The start of my year literally began with a falling out with someone i held dear and close, and it wasn't long after that i've been gaining a shit load of clarity about my own life. It's kind of crazy how some things look to be orchestrated in a way that may start out painful but lead to the greatest thing you've ever experienced. 
<br>
<br>
Funny.
<br>
<br>
This year is all about self-love, as sappy and cringe as that may sound. But not the massive ego version that spews from the maws of witchtok hippie nerds, the realest kind. The most peaceful, satori - like kind.
<br>
<br>
Anyways excuse my hope posting, been on that hopecore shit lately.

<div class="post"><h1>An Embarrassing Talk</h1>
<br>
Alrightyy, here we go. Finally getting into some embarrassing/controversial shit. Warning, we're getting VERY TMI tonight. If you know me IRL, no you don't. Ready guys? Alright, let's chat. 
<br>
<br>
Okay, so let's start with an ego bruising confession:
<br>
<br>
I have a porn addiction.
<br>
<br>
Stellar. Why are you airing your business out for anybody out there in the void to see? 
<br>
<br>
This is not my proudest moment, but this whole porn addiction topic has been on my mind since I've had the grand revelation only a few hours ago. After what i did, it's like lightning hit and i had to sit with myself for a little bit, i began to recognize that i had a huge problem. 

<br>
<br>
I started realizing just how far this whole thing really warped my mental, and i will say right now, this addiction contributed to my ftm transition. Did i ever mention that? Yes, I'm a destransitioner. Around the time i started transitioning, i developed a flavor for gay porn (the shame makes me want to vomit guys, not proud at all). And that lasted an entire year before i finally detransitioned, of which I'll not talk about here. Probably another time.

<br>
<br>
But after researching on the effects of porn to the mind for about two hours including stories from other peeps, i can't say i was surprised i ended up going down that path. Porn changes you the longer you stick with it, it warps your whole sexuality, identity, and mind. People said that you'd progress to more deviant and deviant shit, and that's exactly what's been happening for me. It's absolutely nuts. So i made the decision to quit today. I started by removing all the bookmarks i had saved to my phone, and it shocked me. Literally over 100 saved videos, absolute insanity. 
<br>
<br>
And you're probably thinking: Ain't you the girl with the whole miguel o'hara smut archive?
<br>
<br>
Well, It's different. 

<br>
<br>
And then you say: "Here we go, the addict is yappin, making excuses."

Well, here's the thing. I've never once actually masterdebated to those stories, nuh-uh, not even once in all my years if reading fanfiction. You may find it hard to believe but i actually read that shit for the artistry lol. Sure, i get the tingles n' shit but it's never influenced me the way visual porn has. You thought that pink, sparkly blinkie was for the meme? No! I'm being very literal lmaoo.
<br>
<br>
But anyways, why am i being so candid about all this shameful shit? I just think that being honest about these things would make it easier to talk about in the public consciousness. Like, i don't think you realize how much of an epidemic this shit is especially after the covid lockdowns, rates of porn addiction have skyrocketed to enormous levels amongst both men AND women, both at about the exact same level. Why are we being so hush-hush about this when it's literally just as bad as an actual drug addiction? This shit literally warps your whole ass mind and perception, jesus christ. It has been wrecking relationships, shiii you can look it up online and find so many poor husbands and wives, girlfriends and boyfriends who have been feeling so much hurt due to a porn addicted partner. 

<br>
<br>
I just wish more people would talk about it, y'know? But shit, sex sells in this climate, who'd wanna stop?

<br>
<br>
At least, I've realized my own issues and have started making headway with that. Sometimes all you can do is just change your own self for the better, the people out there? What ever happens, happens i suppose.

<div class="post"><h1>The Tomboy Is Exhausted And Sad</h1>
<br>
Hey hey, it's nanno. Currently editing on my phone cuz the stinky wifi is out, but i had to log on here to spew some thoughts out of my head.
<br>
<br>
Why the fuck is being a toxic bitch so normal??
<br>
<br>
No genuinely i ask, why are so many women just absolute assholes to men? Let's get one thing straight before i get women in here calling me a pick-me (which by the way, has honestly just become another phrase for women to bully other women), I don't think every woman is a toxic dogshit human, i've met many women online and in real life who treat everybody with kindness. I've also met men who deserve nothing but the fiery pits of hell. But let's be truthful for one moment in time, treating and talking about men horribly has been so normalized amongst women, to the point i see this shit happen in real life from women both young and old, it's disgusting y'all.

<br>
<br>
Why am i talking about this? Well i dunno, it's just been something that's been bothering me for awhile, the most recent incidents that made me heated about this topic again are ones that include some of my own males friends in which their partners did some nasty shit (rape allegations, emotional abuse, suicide baiting, etc) to them that left them horribly traumatized, one became so emotionally unstable he's on LITERAL MEDS. These aren't the only reasons either, but they are both just two in a sea of awful examples i see being repeated by women online and in real life, young and old.


<br>
<br>
I don't understand why we cant just be nice to each other and treat each other like humans, ugh.
<br>
<br>
And you know what? This ties right back in to the ending statement i made for my first post here. This behavior towards men is a pain reaction, one that causes more pain. And the cycle just keeps going on from men to women and back. 
<br>

<div class="post"><h1>A Shameless Project</h1>
<br>
Suddenly compiling my favorite miguel fics isn't enough, i NEED a physical book copy. 
<br>
<br>
Yeaaa i'm planning on bookbinding the damn fics lmaooo, is that going a bit far? A bit freaky? i don't give a fuckkk
<br>
<br>
I never liked strictly digital media things anyways, so i guess wanting physical copies of these fanfics would be a natural evolution. Besides, someday i'm going to be a grandma, and when i die i want my family to sort through my belongings and find some freaky shit from my youth. I think it'd be funny lmaoo

<div class="post"><h1>The Mainstream Freak</h1>
<br>
So i was on tiktok trying to find new material to add to my miguel o'hara fanfic collection, and it dawned on me just how mainstream reading fanfiction became when i stumbled across this lady, full face identity and all, sat there in front of the screen and was like, "Hiya there, i spend my entire day reading miguel o'hara fanfiction. Here's some of my favorite smut fics." And this lady looked like one of those put together adults, you know the one, middle class chick blogging her morning routine, organizing her cucumber and fruit ice with timed pomodoro study sessions. 
<br>
<br>
LIKE WHAAT
<br>
<br>
No longer is fanfiction just for the creepy little internet freaks, it's like a fullblown hobby now loool. I mean, i don't mind anyways. That just means more fics i can indulge in >:)
<br>
<br>
Her selection was also pretty A tier btw, gonna add them to my collection soon lol

You know, once you zoom out and take a look at the fullblown picture of a lot of shitty behaviour, you come to realize just how motivated by fear many people really are. It's like that one quote, "Everything in the entire universe is always about love and when it isn't about love it is about the absence of love."
The lengths that many people will go to to try and fill that void, kinda crazy ngl.
