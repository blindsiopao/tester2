    /// I was inspired to post this "template" due to a friend who was unsure about coding but wanted to make a website, and who also enjoyed the look of my current (10th Jun 2023) index page, so I became resolved to clean the code up and annotate it for further help! I'm not assuming that this code is "good" by any means, but it serves me well, and I hope that you can use it well too! Edit it, change it, destroy it to your hearts content.
